## Whats this then?

As I pursue a degree in IT I thought it would be beneficial to work on some nerdy side projects. This is one of them. 

## Art

I'll post occasional drawings, journal excerpts, pens and inks. 

## Programming

One of my electives is learning a programming language so I'll likely post examples of that and others that I want to learn and experiment with. 

## Arch Linux

I've been playing around with Linux off and on, at the moment I'm using Arch. I'll likely talk about that frequently. Especially when it decides to be a fucking piece of shit. 

## Cats

Obviously. 

## Tattoos

Love those fucking things. 

## Misc nerdery. 

Ever want to watch a middle aged person get upset and winded trying to get a Raspberry Pi to work? Then boy do I have conent for you buddy.
