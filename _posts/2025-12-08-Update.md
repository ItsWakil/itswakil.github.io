## What are we doing here? 

Current setup on my main PC is Windows 11 (for school, work apps, and competitive games) dualbooting Arch with KDE Plasma. On my secondary test box I'm using Arch with Hyprland. 

# Why not ditch windows entirely? 

I know that's the trend online right now. Rah rah fuck Windows and all that, but I actually quite like it. Yeah Windows 11 didn't really add anything of value over 10, and it's a little ugly by default, but ehhh. Also it's a requirement for school, it's a requirement for some of my work apps, and it's a requirement for any multiplayer games with kernal anti-cheat. At least I can solve the ugliness problem a bit.

Realistically on my main computer that I work and do hobby stuff from and some of my school work from I just want it to work with minimal tinkering. I don't want to have to worry about forgetting the Hyprland shortcut for opening a browser (Super + B) or anything like that. KDE Plasma is similar enough to Windows and Mac that I don't feel like I'm wrestling with it too hard after a long day of work.

On the other hand if I feel like doing some lighter gaming on my lower end older system or just messing around with updating this website or if I'm feeling particularly nerdy I might be in the mood for a battle of wits between my absolutely fucked memory and Hyprland's shortcuts.
