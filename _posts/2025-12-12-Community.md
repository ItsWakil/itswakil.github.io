# Is this the year of Linux?

Being totally honest? No. It's not. I remember the first time that I ever downloaded a Linux .iso over a 56k connection. It took literally days. Install was very barebones and when it finally installed and booted into Linux everything was very rudimentary and you needed to use the terminal for **everything**. There was no convenient app store, and installing things was not as simple as downloading and running a file by double clicking on it. Since then Linux has come a long way. The installer is usually pretty user friendly and flashy. There are exceptions. Trying to install OpenSUSE as a nvidia user is particularly special. A lot of Linux learning is googling when you run into a problem. Has it come a long way? Yes. Is it ready for the average consumer? Absolutely not. 

## Why? 

I use Arch but lets talk about one of the more user friendly distros aimed at Windows users: Zorin. It's made to look and act like Windows (Or Mac) and it's based on Ubuntu which is very user friendly. I have a secondary computer that is very modern, works great with Windows, works great with Arch, cannot get Zorin to install. The error message during install is vague, Reddit and Google have largely been unable to help, and the only reason that I ever figured it out is because I tried to install a different distro on that same box which gave me a more verbose error message that helped me figure out that the problem was that ZorinOS was trying to use the Windows EFI partition for its bootloader but there wasn't enough space. In order to fix this I had to log back into Windows, download a third party tool, shrink the primary partition, move the unallocated space to be next to the EFI partition and then resize the EFI partition. Maybe I don't have enough faith in the average user but I can't see them doing anything but being discouraged and giving up in that scenario. A lot of people in the Linux community are too in their bubble and frankly sometimes up our asses to understand that not everyone has an understanding anywhere near on the level that we do. If you're using Arch with Hyprland you can no longer relate to new users. 

## Toxicity

One trend that I'm noticing in subreddits for Linux, switching to Linux, or troubleshooting Linux is people trying to dissuade people from dual booting Windows and Linux. They say just move on from Windows entirely, give up your popular games with Anti-Cheat that isn't Linux compatible, etc. They don't realize how insane that sounds to someone who isn't fully invested in Linux. I'm just happy when people try it, but then I also don't have a real problem with Windows. I find it ... inoffensive. That's really all I can say about it. Do I like some of the choices Microsoft has made? Absolutely not. Have I personally had any issues with Windows 11? (Or 10, 8.1, 7, etc) Nope. 

So as Linux users if we want to grow the user base and user in the fabled year of Linux (don't hold your breath) we need to be more welcoming, gatekeep less, and be less standoffish about people wanting to dual boot.
